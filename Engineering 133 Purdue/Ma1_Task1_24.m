% Problem Description: This program will take input of some basic
% arithmetic operations to investigate the difference in syntax and
% commands between MATLAB and python.

% Assignment Information
%   Assignment:     e.g. Team HW9 - MA1

%   My contributor(s) helped me:	
%     [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
%         telling me how they will approach it.
%     [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
%         without helping me plan my solution.
%     [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
%         bug present in my code without looking at my code.
%   Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
%   have to list that person as a contributor here as well.
